Installation
============


The cyberCommons framework utilizes the [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) to expose a RESTful API. The API leverages MongoDB to provide a Catalog and Data Store for storing metadata and data within a JSON document database. The API also includes Celery which is an asynchronous task queue/jobs based on distributed message passing.

## Requirements

* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you are unsure, we recommend installing Docker Desktop.
* [Docker Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#scenario-two-install-the-compose-plugin) if you are not using Docker Desktop.
* GNU Make or equivalent
